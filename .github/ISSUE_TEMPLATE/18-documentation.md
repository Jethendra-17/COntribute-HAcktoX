## Description
Improve code documentation with better comments and JSDoc annotations.

## Current Behavior
Code may lack sufficient documentation and comments.

## Proposed Solution
Add comprehensive comments and JSDoc annotations to components and functions.

## Implementation Ideas
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions and components
- Document component props with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create a documentation section in README
- Document any utility functions
- Add usage examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components have JSDoc comments
- [ ] Props are documented
- [ ] Complex logic is explained with comments
- [ ] README includes component documentation
- [ ] Code is easy to understand for new contributors

## Additional Context
Good documentation makes it easier for others to contribute!
