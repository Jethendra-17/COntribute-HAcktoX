## Description
Add search functionality to help users find content on the site.

## Current Behavior
There is no search feature on the site.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a search bar that filters or searches through site content.

## Implementation Ideas
- Add search input in header or dedicated section
- Implement client-side search for static content
- Search could filter features, testimonials, or blog posts
- Show search results with highlighting
- Include keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+K)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search input added to appropriate location
- [ ] Search filters content in real-time or on submit
- [ ] Results are displayed clearly
- [ ] "No results" message shown when appropriate
- [ ] Search is accessible and keyboard-friendly

## Additional Context
For a static site, implement client-side search. For dynamic content, consider Algolia or similar services.
