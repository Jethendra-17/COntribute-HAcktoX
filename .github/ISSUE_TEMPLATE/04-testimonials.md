## Description
Create a functional testimonials section to display user testimonials or reviews.

## Current Behavior
The testimonials section exists but has no actual testimonials.

## Proposed Solution
Add real or placeholder testimonials with a carousel or grid layout.

## Implementation Ideas
- Create testimonial cards with user photo, name, and quote
- Implement a carousel for browsing testimonials (optional)
- Or use a simple grid layout with multiple testimonials
- Add star ratings or company logos

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 3-6 testimonials displayed
- [ ] Each testimonial has name, quote, and optional photo
- [ ] Layout is responsive and looks good on all devices
- [ ] Design matches overall site aesthetic

## Additional Context
You can use libraries like react-slick for carousels or implement with vanilla React.
