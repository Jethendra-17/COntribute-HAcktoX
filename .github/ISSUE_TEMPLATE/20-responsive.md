## Description
Improve responsive design to ensure the site looks great on all device sizes.

## Current Behavior
Some sections may not be optimally responsive on mobile or tablet devices.

## Proposed Solution
Audit and improve responsive design across all sections and devices.

## Implementation Ideas
- Test on various device sizes using DevTools
- Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints effectively
- Adjust spacing, typography, and layouts for mobile
- Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized (min 44x44px)
- Test on real devices if possible
- Improve image responsiveness

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Site tested on mobile (320px-480px)
- [ ] Site tested on tablet (768px-1024px)
- [ ] All sections are properly responsive
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on small screens
- [ ] Typography scales appropriately

## Additional Context
Use Chrome DevTools device emulation and test on multiple breakpoints.
