## Description
Add unit tests to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.

## Current Behavior
The project currently has no tests.

## Proposed Solution
Set up a testing framework and add unit tests for components and utilities.

## Implementation Ideas
- Set up Vitest or Jest with React Testing Library
- Write tests for React components
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Add tests for utility functions
- Aim for reasonable code coverage
- Set up CI to run tests automatically

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testing framework is set up (Vitest/Jest)
- [ ] At least 3-5 components have tests
- [ ] Tests cover key user interactions
- [ ] Tests run successfully with npm test
- [ ] CI/CD includes test execution

## Additional Context
Start with testing simple components and gradually add more coverage.
