## Description
Add smooth, engaging animations to the hero section to make the landing more dynamic.

## Current Behavior
The hero section is static without any animations.

## Proposed Solution
Add fade-in, slide-in, or other animations to hero elements using CSS animations or a library.

## Implementation Ideas
- Animate the heading with a fade-in effect
- Add a slide-up animation to the description text
- Animate the CTA button with a bounce or pulse effect
- Consider using Framer Motion or pure CSS animations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Animations are smooth and not jarring
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] Performance is not negatively impacted
- [ ] Animations trigger on page load

## Additional Context
Animations should enhance the user experience, not distract from content.
