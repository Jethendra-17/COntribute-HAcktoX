## Description
Add a newsletter subscription section with email input and submit button.

## Current Behavior
There is no newsletter subscription option on the site.

## Proposed Solution
Create a newsletter subscription form, typically in the footer or as a dedicated section.

## Implementation Ideas
- Design a clean email input with submit button
- Add form validation for email format
- Show success/error messages
- Consider using services like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or Buttondown
- Or implement frontend-only validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Newsletter section added with email input
- [ ] Email validation implemented
- [ ] Submit button properly styled
- [ ] Success message shown on submission
- [ ] Form is accessible and responsive
- [ ] Error handling for invalid emails

## Additional Context
For a demo site, frontend validation is sufficient. For production, you'd integrate with an email service.
