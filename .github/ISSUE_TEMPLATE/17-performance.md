## Description
Optimize the site for better performance and faster loading times.

## Current Behavior
The site may have performance optimization opportunities.

## Proposed Solution
Implement various performance optimizations to improve loading speed and user experience.

## Implementation Ideas
- Optimize images (compression, modern formats like WebP)
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Code splitting for JavaScript bundles
- Minimize CSS and remove unused styles
- Add performance budgets
- Optimize fonts loading
- Implement caching strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score improved
- [ ] Images are optimized and lazy-loaded
- [ ] Unused CSS/JS is removed or split
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP) is fast
- [ ] Time to Interactive (TTI) is optimized

## Additional Context
Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance analysis.
