## Description
Add a pricing section with different pricing tiers or plans.

## Current Behavior
There is no pricing section on the site.

## Proposed Solution
Create pricing cards showing different plans with features and pricing.

## Implementation Ideas
- Design 2-3 pricing tier cards (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- List features for each tier
- Add a highlighted "Popular" or "Recommended" plan
- Include call-to-action buttons
- Make it responsive

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 2-3 pricing tiers displayed
- [ ] Each tier shows price, features, and CTA button
- [ ] One tier is highlighted as recommended
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Styling matches the site theme

## Additional Context
Even if pricing is not real, this is a common component pattern to practice.
