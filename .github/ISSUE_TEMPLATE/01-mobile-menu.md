## Description
Add a responsive mobile navigation menu to the header that works well on smaller screens.

## Current Behavior
The navigation currently displays horizontally and may not be optimal for mobile devices.

## Proposed Solution
Create a hamburger menu that appears on mobile devices and expands to show navigation links.

## Implementation Ideas
- Add a hamburger icon that toggles the menu
- Use Tailwind CSS responsive classes
- Add smooth animations for menu transitions
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hamburger menu appears on screens smaller than 768px
- [ ] Menu toggles open/closed on click
- [ ] Navigation links are accessible in mobile view
- [ ] Smooth animation when opening/closing
- [ ] Menu closes when a link is clicked

## Additional Context
This will improve the mobile user experience significantly.
