## Description
Add scroll-based animations to make content appear as users scroll down the page.

## Current Behavior
Content appears static without scroll animations.

## Proposed Solution
Implement scroll animations that trigger when elements come into view.

## Implementation Ideas
- Use Intersection Observer API
- Or use libraries like AOS (Animate On Scroll) or Framer Motion
- Add fade-in, slide-in, or zoom animations
- Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Keep animations subtle and professional

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Animations trigger when scrolling to sections
- [ ] At least 3-4 sections have scroll animations
- [ ] Animations are smooth and not distracting
- [ ] Performance is not negatively impacted
- [ ] Respects prefers-reduced-motion setting

## Additional Context
Keep animations smooth and professional - avoid overly flashy effects.
